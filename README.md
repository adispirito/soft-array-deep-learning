# Soft Array Deep Learning
 Repo containing the Soft Array Project Code

# Run instructions
Go to the root of the repo, and run the executable command ```./docker_build.sh --gpus=all``` to open a Jupyter notebook docker container environment that is already setup for running my DL code.

# Repo Structure Summary
Once you run the executable, you will be placed in the src folder, which will serve as the new project root folder. In this folder, you will find various Jupyter notebooks, which cover data preprocessing steps, model training (under various configurations), and testing model inference. In the subfolder titles ```python```, you will find all the helper functions and model definitions used for this project. 

# Data Availability
